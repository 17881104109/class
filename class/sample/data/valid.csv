joshulin,"This bathing suit is so flattering! I’m 4’11 with 38DDD bust & size 8 in pants, it’s very hard for me to find bathing suits that flatter my body! This one is perfect! I ordered the XL specifically for my chest & it fit how I wanted with a tiny bit more room!",1,0,0,1,,
Amanda LaMonica,LOVE LOVE LOVE!! I'm 5'4" and 140 lbs. I'm more of a pear shape and typically wear a medium in everything. Based off other reveiws I ordered a large. This bathing suite made me write a review because of how well it fit and is very flattering (and looking at other reviewers its great for any body type!). Get this suit!,1,0,0,0,,
pghpetphotog,"I'm 5'9"" and 125lbs, so finding a one-piece that fits is like finding the Holy Grail.  This one is comfortable, cute, and true to color.  It held up really well in the mineral pools we frequented, and I'm sure it will do just as well at the beach.  Arrived quickly and neatly packaged.",1,0,1,1,,
Hutto,"I've bought FIVE of these, I'm so in love with them! The fit is great and so flattering, the quality is fantastic, and you cannot beat this price! I told my boyfriend I got it on Amazon, and he said ""it looks like it's from Victoria's Secret!""",0,1,0,1,,
Adele C.,Beautiful suit.  I did return the first suit due to it running a little large in the legs.  The next size down fit much better.  I replaced the cups in the suit with more supportive ones and now the suit is perfect.  I ordered both the black suit and the teal.  Very pleased.,-1,0,1,0,,
M. Bowen,"This suit is super cute, my daughter got loads of compliments. However the quality is really lacking. After maybe 15 times wearing this suit (and properly taking care of it), the elasticity is gone and it is seriously sagging. Bummer because it was so cute but I’m not going to buy another.",0,-1,0,1,,
Jessica,Love this suit!  I live in the water during the summer and go through a few swimsuits each summer.  Love this way more than I expected!  5’8” 200# 40DD.  1XL was perfect.  Ordering 2 more right now!,1,0,0,0,,
Stefani,I didn’t have high expectations ordering a swim suit off Amazon and was blown away. It fits me perfectly. Makes me look thin and is adorable. None of my friends could believe it was an Amazon but!,1,0,0,1,,
Runner2183,This suit is very cute.  I'm an older woman and this is fashionable and cute without being too revealing.  Leaves a bit to the imagination!  The suit fits just as expected as well.,1,0,0,1,,
Bewitched21,"I cant believe that this suit fits as well as it does for not even trying it on before buying! I am 5'7"" 155 (36C, 31 in waist and about 39 hips) and ordered a large,fits perfect. Probably going to order more colors. Love it!!",1,0,0,0,,
Missy J.,"A gorgeous gorgeous gorgeous suit. Photos don’t do it justice. I’m 5’2”, 145lb, and SUPER busty - ordered a large and it fits perfectly. Slimming AND sexy. I’m not a huge fan of things around my neck, and this neckline DOES feel a little snug but you adjust to it pretty quick",-1,0,0,1,,
P. Johnson,I cannot believe how much I love this suit...I dreaded buying one for my upcoming vacation but took a chance because of the great reviews. It is so flattering...I love it!! I ordered the green one and it's so cute!,0,0,1,0,,
Amazon Customer,Love everything about this swimsuit! It is extremely flattering on most body types! I recommend going up a size to be sure it fits. Use the seller size guides to be sure I got the right size.,1,0,0,0,,
Amazon Customer,"I liked the look of this bathing suit and for the price, I had to give it a try! I ordered the navy blue in a XL. For reference, I’m 5 6, C cup and 185 pounds. It was too large up top, fit nicely in the waist and legs but felt like it was missing material on the butt! I’ll have I wear a pair or shorts while walking around. Overall, it’s worth it for an extra bathing suit but I wish I would have tried the plus size 14. Maybe it would have fit better on top and had more coverage of my behind!",-1,0,0,0,,
InVinoVeritas,"Love it. To give a reference point, I am 5’7, about 130lbs give or take and 34C.  I got a medium. Fits awesome through tummy and chest. A teeny bit snug (snug is actually a harsh word for what it is) on the bottom. But the next size up wouldn’t fit right either. I will say that if you have pronounced collar bones, the straps might be a bit tight. So the long torso girls like myself, just be aware.",-1,0,0,0,,
Nicole H,Very nice flattering swimsuit. I'm 5' 7" and sometimes buying one pieces can be tricky because the length of the torso. This one fit like a glove and it keeps excess fat in check....or at least is does for me.,1,0,0,1,,
Sarah,"I really love this swimsuit.  I was a little worried because it was so inexpensive, but it looks and fit better that swimsuits that I have purchased for 3 times the price.  I am 5'4"" and 160 lbs and the large fit great.",1,0,0,0,,
Tdub,I just lost 50 pounds and this is the first nice swim suit I have bought myself in over 10 years!!! Fits amazing and my triple d’s look great!!!! Good support everywhere. Only negative is the pads I’ll be removing them.,-1,0,0,0,,
First Time Mom,"I love it! Looks great. The straps up top are a bit tight, but not a deal breaker at all. The material tends to ride up a little on the butt cheeks. Would recommend sizing up if you favor in your bottom side. I love the color. I have a boyshort bottom that I will probably wear over it and the shape is so flattering. Very slimming in the midsection.",-1,0,1,0,,
Tara Hennessy,"I got a large since I'm between a 6/8 on most days. Its a little snug in the breasticle area but, you know that's just added support I guess. Everything else got comfortably. Looks damn good as well.",1,0,0,1,,
nursenae215,I'm a size M and i got a size m and it fits good.  Perfect for running after my toddler at the pool and also stylish at the same time.  Only issue its so good 3 other people at the pool has the same one.  But thankfully we all had different colors.,1,0,0,1,,
Shannon Walters,Size:XL I’m speechless how sexy and lovely this swimsuit is! I’m 5’4 200lbs with most weight in my hips and butt and this suit is omg sexy! No fat ha going anywhere because the shear back with keyhole. And the tummy style hides my tummy. Fully covers my butt and makes my 38DDD look S-E-X-Y! I’m buying this suit in other colors too!!,1,0,0,1,,
Krystal Solano,The suit is very flattering.  Bought it for a spa day and was complimented the entire day!  I am a size 10/12 and it is true to size and the fit itself is great.  Very comfortable and I absolutely love it.  Friends are already going to purchase the suit too because of how cute it looks!,1,0,0,1,,
Regan,I love this swim suit I am 5’3 an weigh about 195 pounds. I have received nothing but compliments on this swimsuit. The chest fits a little loose (I borderline C-D) but the waist fits nice. I ordered it in black and tempted to get the wine color one. I have no regret on this purchase,-1,0,-1,1,,
P M,"I was very worried about this because I have a large chest but I felt really comfortable it. It was very slimming around the tummy area, however the neck was slightly irritating after wearing it for most of the day. Still really liked it and plan on wearing it often.",-1,0,0,1,,
Ashley,I love this swimsuit. It’s fantastic. The color is great. The fit is amazing and very flattering. The price could not be beat. Now I kinda want one in every color! Five stars,1,0,1,0,,
Jessica,"If I could give this a ten star rating, I would! I’ve been so hesitant on buying swimsuits online, but this is the most flattering bathing suit I’ve ever owned. I bought the black, and it’s so cute and classy! I’m a size 8, 34D and I got the medium. I thought it was just right! I immediately ordered another color the same day I got this one in!",1,0,1,1,,
Meg,This swimsuit is stylish and comfy! I ordered a L (I’m 5’1” and 150 lbs) and it fits great. I got several compliments on it. I switch out this swimsuit and another one because this swimsuit will leave weird tan lines!!,1,0,-1,0,,
Tabitha O.,"Cute bathing suit that looks really good with fake breasts.  My only complaint is in the back where the lace strap meets the rest of the material, there’s a little fat bulge.  Kind of like the little bugles you get from a bra.",-1,0,0,1,,
Lindsey Ells,"Suit fit true to size. Makes bust looks sexy, but not trashy. Wish the butt fit was a bit more cheeky as is a full coverage bottom. Also the back of suit goes up a little high and creates kind of a back fat bulge for me...but overall happy with suit!",-1,0,0,1,,
Amazon Customer,"I absolutely love this suit.  After having two kids in the past three years (my youngest is now 6 months old and I’m still breastfeeding), this swimsuit looks unbelievably amazing on me. And trust me, NOTHING looks amazing on me right now. Even normal clothes. To day this about a swimsuit is unheard of. It’s incredibly flattering and hides all your bad spots. LADIES BUY IT IMMEDIATELY!!!",1,0,0,0,,
CeeBee,Absolutely LOVE this swimsuit!! My favorite of all time. Fits to size and very flattering. Great quality! Had it over a year now and still in great shape. Would highly recommend.,1,1,0,1,,
JV,"Bought this last minute for a pool party; it fit perfectly!!! Very supportive and comfortable. The back is beautiful! It's VERY flattering. I felt secure wearing this the entire time, and the roushing (sp? - scrunchy middle section) made me very comfy and not self conscious at all. I honestly am tempted to wear this with some shorts as an outfit!",1,0,0,1,,
Toni R. Wise,Ordered once and it was too small (runs small).  Ordered it again and it fits great but the mesh is coming apart from the bathing suit.  So disappointed.  Was suppose to use it on my trip that I’m going on right at this moment.  So frustrating.,-1,0,0,0,,
